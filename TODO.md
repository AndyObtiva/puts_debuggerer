# TODO

Here are tasks considered for future versions. Once done, they are moved to the [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)

## Next

### Version TBD

- Support pd arg1, arg2, arg3
- Support Ruby logger API and/or logging gem (and consider adding a formatting for it for logging/logger library)
* fix issue with printing in rspec inside a Rails project without having to do extra configuration
* fix issue with erb support
* display run_at run number in printout
* implement fallback in irb for when line number cannot be discovered (issue happens in pry, perhaps this just means support pry)
